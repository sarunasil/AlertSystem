get sensor and ringer mac list from sqlite

if current_connected ringers and current_connected sensors < ringers and sensors from sqlite:
    if there is a disconnected device - remove it and print a message about it
    scan all available devices
        create list of ringer and sensors available now
    try to connect to available ringers and sensors if not in connected devices lis already
        if connnected - ok
        if failed - pass

    wait 15 sec?

Delegates deal with incomming messages - if sensor sent "ALARM"
    call function to write to sqlite and another function to send out message to all ringers WITH this sensor name

- every 1min check sqlite for changes in sensor an ringer list
