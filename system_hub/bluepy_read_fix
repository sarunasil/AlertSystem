For the .readCharacteristics() to work properly
you have to modify your bluepy btle.py file

for me it was in ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/bluepy
open btle.py file and find:

    def readCharacteristic(self, handle):
        self._writeCmd("rd %X\n" % handle)
        resp = self._getResp('rd')
        return resp['d'][0]

and change for:

    def readCharacteristic(self, handle, wantType=None):
        self._writeCmd("rd %X\n" % handle)
        resp = self._getResp(['rd']+[wantType])
        return resp['d'][0]

now instead of .readCharacteristic(your_handle)
just call .readCharacteristic(your_handle, wantType='ntfy')

What we think is happening is that this Chinese chip is sending data
in 'ntfy' (notify) package instead or 'rd' package. (Notify package is probably
supposed to come first and carry no data)
Some libraries or platforms may not care about this but
bluepy is only displaying data that comes from packages with 'rd' (read) type
and as this 'rd' package is 'data' content is undefined or empty, the incorrect
value is displayed.

by passing 'ntfy' as a parameter you are saying to return data from this package type



--- Had to make another modification ---
to make getState to work
check getState()
and self.status()
